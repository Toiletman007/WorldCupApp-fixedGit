This was a simple project which I used to learn listview with a custom item layout.
It's just a list of countries with pictures of their respective flags and a number of wins the countries have which are random please don't get offended lol.
If you click a item on the list a toast message shows up telling you which coutry you clicked on and how many wins it has.
